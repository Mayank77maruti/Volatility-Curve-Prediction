Volatility plays a central role in options trading, offering insight into market expectations, uncertainty, and risk. Accurately forecasting implied volatility can reveal directional signals that are key to building effective trading strategies. In this challenge, your goal is to develop a model that predicts implied volatilities for NIFTY50 index options using high-frequency market data.

Implied volatility is more than just a number — it reflects how the market prices future movement across different strikes and maturities. The volatility curve, often taking a smile-like shape when plotted against strike price, captures this structure. Modeling it effectively means understanding not just the level of volatility, but how it shifts with market dynamics.

Description
In this competition, you’ll work with per-second historical data for NIFTY50 index options, including implied volatilities and a set of anonymized features drawn from real-world trading environments. Your goal is to predict missing implied volatility values across a range of strikes — reconstructing a more complete view of the market’s expectation of future movement.
In order to get a sense of what IV is, we must first learn about the Black Scholes model, a fundamental method used for pricing options. Now, given the prices of the underlying, the option, the time to expiry and the risk free rate, we can calculate the value of volatility that would satisfy Black Scholes, this value is known as the Implied volatility. More information about this can be found here.
We’ve built this challenge to reflect the kinds of questions we regularly explore: how to uncover structure in noisy data, how to model fast-moving market behavior, and how to refine our understanding of volatility itself. We’re excited to see the range of approaches the community brings to this problem and look forward to learning from your insights as we continue building better models ourselves.
For those interested in exploring similar problems beyond the competition, we offer opportunities to work more closely on real-world challenges in dynamic market settings.
